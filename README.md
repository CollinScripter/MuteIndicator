**Note**: This plugin only works on *Windows*

# Abandoned
I personally do not use BetterDiscord. To update it to modern versions of BetterDiscord, simply update the variables channelBar and mute.

## What is this?
This is a plugin for BetterDiscord that will display a ball with a the muted symbol on your main monitor.

## Installation
Just drop the MuteIndicator.plugin.js and the MuteIndicator.html files into the BetterDiscord plugin folder, and enable the plugin through the BetterDiscord plugin menu.

## Preview
Coming soon...
